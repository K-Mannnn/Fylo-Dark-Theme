## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In this project I tried to improve on using more semantic HTml mark up and make the webpage more accessible and also more compatible to various screen sizes. This landing page was built using pure CSS and Html so I learnt some limitations on customising validation error messages and hiding the default built in Html ones which is without the help of Javascript cannot be acheived. 

### Continued development

Making element more responsive according to screen sizes and using the width property more accurately.
